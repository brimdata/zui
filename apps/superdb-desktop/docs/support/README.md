# Support Resources

The Zui support resources explain:

* the [platforms](Supported-Platforms.md) on which the app is supported,
* the [filesystem paths](Filesystem-Paths.md) where application binaries and user data are stored on different platforms, and
* [troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md) tips in case you experience problems.
