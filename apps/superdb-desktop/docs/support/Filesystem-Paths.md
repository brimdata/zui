# Filesystem Paths

Occasionally when using Zui or troubleshooting problems with it, you may need
to know the location on the filesystem where the application binaries and/or user
data is stored. Below you'll find these details for each supported platform.

## Application Binaries

When installed, the binaries and other supporting files that make up the Zui
application are unpacked to the following path on each platform:

|**OS Platform**|**Install Type**|**Location**                                |
|---------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Windows**   | Current user    | `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Zui` |
| **Windows**   | All users      | `%ProgramFiles%\Zui`                       |
| **macOS**     |                | `/Applications/Zui.app`                    |
| **Linux**     |                | `/opt/Zui`                                 |

This filesystem location should be treated as read-only and is typically
only modified when a newer version of the app is being installed.

Since Zui is most often launched directly from the GUI environment in your OS,
you'll typically not need to access the application binaries directly. One
exception is if you wish to make use of the command line binaries that are
bundled with the app, such as [`zq`](https://zed.brimdata.io/docs/commands/zq/),
[`zed`](https://zed.brimdata.io/docs/commands/zed/),
[`brimcap`](https://github.com/brimdata/brimcap), and so forth. These can be
found in the `zdeps` subdirectory as follows:

|**OS Platform**|**Install Type**|**Location**                                                                  |
|---------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Windows**   | Current user    | `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Programs\Zui\resources\app.asar.unpacked\zdeps` |
| **Windows**   | All users      | `%ProgramFiles%\Zui\resources\app.asar.unpacked\zdeps`                       |
| **macOS**     |                | `/Applications/Zui.app/Contents/Resources/app.asar.unpacked/zdeps`           |
| **Linux**     |                | `/opt/Zui/resources/app.asar.unpacked/zdeps`                                 |

While these binaries are also available for download as standalone release
packages for [Zed](https://github.com/brimdata/zed/releases) or [Brimcap](https://github.com/brimdata/brimcap/releases), if you're
using CLI commands to interact with a pool in the Zed lake that runs behind
Zui, you should typically use these bundled `zdeps` binaries since they've
been tested with the same version of Zui and can be considered API-compatible
with that version of the app.

## User Data

Saved data from your work in Zui is stored in a read/write filesystem path
that's separate from the application binaries. The top-level user data path on
each supported platform is:

|**OS Platform**|**Location**                                          |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Windows**   | `%APPDATA%\Zui`                                      |
| **macOS**     | `$HOME/Library/Application Support/Zui`              |
| **Linux**     | `$HOME/.config/Zui`                                  |

Particular categories of saved data are held under this path. Specific
categories of interest include:

   * `plugins` (subdirectory) - Storage used by tools bundled with Zui, such as
     [Brimcap](https://github.com/brimdata/brimcap).

   * `lake` (subdirectory) - Storage for the local Zed lake that holds data imported into Zui.

   * `logs` (subdirectory) - Logs for the running Zui app and the Zed backend
     that it launches for data storage and query.

   * `appState.json` (file) - Persistent app settings such as changes you've
     made to **Settings**, contents of the **Query Library**, entries
     in the **History** panel, and so forth.

Generally you should not need to directly access the saved user data, though
it may prove necessary during [troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md) or if you use
[`zed`](https://zed.brimdata.io/docs/commands/zed/)
or [`brimcap`](https://github.com/brimdata/brimcap) CLI tools
to perform scripted operations from outside the app against data that's stored
behind Zui.

## Temporary Storage

Zui and the bundled Zed/Brimcap tools often make use of temporary storage.
Some examples:

* The **Zed** backend may use temporary storage to "spill to disk" when
performing [`sort`](https://zed.brimdata.io/docs/language/operators/sort/),
[`fuse`](https://zed.brimdata.io/docs/language/operators/fuse/),
or [aggregations](https://zed.brimdata.io/docs/language/aggregates/) on data sets that cannot fit into allocated system
memory. For this, Zed uses a directory with a name that starts with
`zed-spill-`. The directory is automatically deleted when the operation
finishes.

* **Brimcap** uses temporary directories to store the raw logs generated by
[analyzers](https://github.com/brimdata/brimcap#included-analyzers) (e.g.,
Zeek and Suricata) before they're loaded into a pool in a Zed lake. For this,
Brimcap uses a directory with a name that starts with `brimcap-`. The
directory is automatically deleted when `brimcap analyze` finishes.

* In **Zui** when the **Packets** button is clicked to extract a flow from
a larger pcap, the extracted packets are placed in a temporary file that's
opened in Wireshark. For this, Zui uses a file with a name of the format
`packets-[date+timestamp].pcap` (e.g., `packets-2020-03-09T17_27_53.399273Z.pcap`).
This file is _not_ deleted automatically, as Zui does not make any assumptions
about what you may continue to do with the pcap file outside the app.

Standard conventions are used for creating these directories/files in the
appropriate location for each supported platform. As a result, temporary
storage may be freed up automatically by the OS during normal operations, such
as when performing a system restart or running common cleanup utilities.
However, bugs or abrupt shutdowns of Zed/Brimcap processes (e.g., `kill -9` or
similar) may prevent the tools from deleting their temporary directories as
individual operations finish. This may lead to excess consumption of temporary
storage over time, particularly if your temporary storage is not regularly
cleared in the course of normal operations.

If during the course of operations or debugging you'd like to check for signs
of unreaped temporary storage, you can look below a base temporary directory
for your platform. Below we describe the expected base location in an "out of
the box" default configuration of each supported platform.

* **Windows** - The base path specified in the `%TMP%` environment variable
is used. In a default test environment we've found this variable is already
set and is typically of a format like
`C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Temp` or
`C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Temp\2`.

* **macOS** - The base path specified in the `$TMPDIR` environment variable is
used. In a default test environment we've found this variable is already set
and is typically of a format like `/var/folders/yn/jbkxxkpd4vg142pc3_bd_krc0000gn/T/`.

* **Linux** - A base path specified in a `$TMPDIR` environment variable would be
used, if it were set. However, in default test environments we've found this
variable is typically not set, and therefore the `/tmp` path is used.

:::tip
Detailed explanations for the logic used for locating the
temporary storage location can be found in the
[Electron docs](https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/app#appgetpathname) (for Zui)
and the [Go docs](https://pkg.go.dev/os#TempDir) (for Zed/Brimcap).
:::

If you'd like to change the base temporary storage path that's used by Zui
and the Zed/Brimcap tools, just ensure that Zui is launched after having set
the environment variable mentioned above that's appropriate for your platform.
