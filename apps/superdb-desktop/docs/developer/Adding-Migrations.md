# Adding Migrations

Because we persist state on a user's computer, we must migrate that state each time we release a version that changes the schema expected by the app. If any of the reducers in `src/js/state` are changed, we need to write a migration. When the app starts, it will automatically run all the pending migrations.

## Creating a Migration

Let's say we've added a property called `nickname` to each lake connection in the app. We'll use the migration generator tool to create the necessary files. From the root directory, run `bin/gen migration <name>`. For example:

```bash
bin/gen migration addNicknameToConnection
```

This created a migration file and a test file, each with a timestamp.

```
Created: src/js/state/migrations/202007101024_addNicknameToConnection.js
Created: src/js/state/migrations/202007101024_addNicknameToConnection.test.js
```

The migration function takes the previous state as an parameter and returns the new desired state.

In this case:

```js
export default function addNicknameToConnection(state) {
  // Migrate state here
  return state
}
```

As of this writing, the schema of the persisted state is called `SessionState` and is defined in: `src/js/electron/tron/formatSessionState.js`

## Testing Your Migration

The migrations only ever run when we release a new version. To test your migration, you'll need a sample of the session state from the most recent release tag. Let's say the last release was `v0.13.1`. We can easily get a snapshot of the state at that version following these steps.

```bash
# Remove your "run" directory which clears the app state in development
rm -fr run
# Check out the last version
git checkout v0.13.1
# Start the app
yarn && yarn start
```

Now get the app into a state that you want to test against. In this example, we would add a few connections so we can ensure they have nicknames after the migration.

When ready, go to the App Menu and click `Developer => Save Session for Testing Migrations`.

![Save Session Menu Item](media/save-session-menu-item.png)

This will save the session state and inform you where the file is.

![Session Saved Popup](media/session-saved-popup.png)

The name of the JSON file is just today's date, so it might be helpful to rename it to the version that you're targeting like `v0.13.1.json`

```bash
mv src/js/test/states/202007091803.json src/js/test/states/v0.13.1.json
```

Then in the migration test file, you can access this file using the helper function, `getTestState(name)`.

```js
// src/js/state/migrations/202007101024_addNicknameToConnection.test.js

import getTestState from "src/test/helpers/getTestState"
import migrate from "./202007101024_addNicknameToConnection"

test("202007101024_addNicknameToConnection", () => {
  // The test data we just saved. Returns: {version: string, data: SessionState}
  let {data} = getTestState("v0.13.1")

  const next = migrate(data)

  /* Let's pretend the test data had three connections and the migration added
    "no nickname" as the default nickname for each of them. */
  const {connections} = next.globalState

  expect(connections.length).toBe(3)

  connections.forEach((connection) => {
    expect(connection.nickname).toBe("no nickname")
  })
})
```

Once you've got that test passing, you're home free. The app will see the new migration and run it automatically the next time someone upgrades.
