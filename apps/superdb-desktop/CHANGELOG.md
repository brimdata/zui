## v0.31.0

### The Brim app will be renamed to Zui!

_Pronounced: “zoo-ee”_

This is the last release under the name Brim. In the next version, the app will be renamed to Zui. The changes in this release improve the auto-update messaging for the name change in the next release.

### Behind the Name Change

When Brim began as a company, we intended to build a security-focused desktop application powered by our backend called [Zed](https://zed.brimdata.io/). The company's main product was the app, so we called it the Brim app.

As we developed Zed, we started to realize we had something big on our hands. Zed's data model, language, query engine, and storage formats provide revolutionary new ways to work with all kinds of data. In April 2021, we decided to pivot, making Zed the company's flagship technology. Brim Security became Brim Data.

This change made us reevaluate the purpose of the app. We were now leading with the [Zed lake](https://zed.brimdata.io/docs/commands/zed), so we decided the app would support the lake. Users would be able to explore a lake's data and manage its configuration with the app. It would be a GUI for Zed.

At this point, having the app named after the company was confusing. We needed a name that clearly tied the app to Zed. After many fun naming sessions, we played off the word "GUI" and landed on "Zui": The Zed user interface.

### Get Zui Today

If you are excited about the next version and want to try it out today, download the [Zui - Insiders](https://github.com/brimdata/zui-insiders) app. It can run side-by-side with Brim, stores data in a different location, and runs Zed on a different port. It receives automatic updates every weekday built from the tip of our main branch. This is our take on a beta program. If you find bugs or think of improvements, please chime in on the [#zui-insiders](https://brimdata.slack.com/archives/C03MW6XT7HC) Slack channel.

## v0.30.0

In this small release, we've fixed bugs and upgraded some core dependencies like Electron and React.

- Upgrade to Electron 15, Node 16 (#2342)
- Upgrade to React 18 (#2327)
- Fix "Pivot to Logs" corner cases (#2354) (#2346)
- Fix `zed -version` and `brimcap -version` output (#2349)
- Fix rendering of big arrays that would previously crash the app (#2348)
- Fix bug causing the "About" window to appear blank (#2347)

## v0.29.0

### Where are my pools?

Your pools are still here! But you need to run a migration script to convert them to the new Zed lake data format.

**[How to migrate](https://github.com/brimdata/brim/wiki/Migration-for-Version-0.29)**

If you don't care to keep the old data, no need to run the migration. The app will work fine. Click the link above to learn how to remove the old pools if you desire.

### New Features

This release includes exciting new features we hope you'll find very useful. However, most of the work for this release was focused on the Zed backend that powers Brim. Zed 1.0 is here! Check out the [release notes for Zed 1.0](https://github.com/brimdata/zed/blob/v1.0.0/CHANGELOG.md#v100)

### Inspector View

The largest new feature you'll notice is the addition of the inspector view. The inspector lets you clearly see the shape of nested data structures. You can expand or collapse data containers like records and arrays.

You can toggle back and forth between this view and the familiar table view.

The buttons on the right of the results header will expand and collapse all the nested data structures.

### New Font

Brim now uses the excellent, open source [Recursive](https://www.recursive.design/) font family to display your data.

## v0.25.0

As you can see below, there've been many changes since the last Brim GA release! Highlights include:

- The storage used by Brim to hold your logs is now a Zed lake. Though the
  introduction of Zed lakes causes no immediate change to your favorite Brim
  workflows, they unlock powerful new functionality that will be revealed in
  Brim going forward, including Git-like branching. See the
  [Zed lake README](https://github.com/brimdata/zed/blob/v0.30.0/docs/lake/README.md)
  for details.
- Enhancements have been made to the Zed language to unify search and
  expression syntax, introduce new operators and functions for data
  exploration and shaping, and more! Review the
  [Zed language docs](https://github.com/brimdata/zed/blob/v0.30.0/docs/language/README.md)
  for details.
- pcap processing is now handled by a separate, new component
  called Brimcap. Your favorite pcap workflows in Brim have not changed, but
  Brimcap also opens up new flexible custom configurations and can be used as
  a standalone tool. For more info, check out the
  Brimcap [README](https://github.com/brimdata/brimcap/blob/main/README.md)
  and [wiki](https://github.com/brimdata/brimcap/wiki).

Among the many detailed changes listed below, there're a few big ones in
particular we'd like to bring to your attention first.

- You will be prompted upon first launch of Brim `v0.25.0` to allow
  auto-migration of saved data from your `v0.24.0` Spaces to pools in Zed
  lakes.

- Brim `v0.25.0` includes a new installer that will make upgrades to future
  versions more seamless. However, when making the jump from `v0.24.0` to the
  newer release:

  - Windows users will not be prompted to auto-update as they were in the
    past. Windows users will also have to manually uninstall the old release
    before `v0.25.0` will start. Auto-update notifications for Windows will
    resume on the
    next release. See the
    [Installation](https://github.com/brimdata/brim/blob/v0.25.0/docs/Installation.md#windows-installation-v0250)
    article on the Brim wiki for details.
  - Linux users of RPM packages (such as for Red Hat-style distributions) will
    need to uninstall the older `v0.24.0` release before the RPM package for
    `v0.25.0` will successfully install. See the
    [Linux RPM Upgrade](https://github.com/brimdata/brim/wiki/Linux-RPM-Upgrade)
    article in the Brim wiki for details.

  Note that a Brim uninstall does _not_ disturb the data you've saved in
  the app. See the [Filesystem Paths](https://github.com/brimdata/brim/wiki/Filesystem-Paths)
  article in the Brim wiki for details of how Brim stores user data separately
  from app binaries.

- When upgrading to `v0.25.0`, the pre-installed entries in the Query Library
  are auto-updated to adapt to new Zed language syntax. However, if you've
  saved custom entries to the Query Library, you'll need to change these
  yourself. Some key changes include `:=` now being used for assignment, `==`
  for equality comparisons, and string values
  must now be quoted in [field/value](https://github.com/brimdata/zed/blob/v0.30.0/docs/language/search-syntax/README.md) matches.

The exhaustive set of changes is listed below. Come talk to us on
[Slack](https://www.brimdata.io/join-slack/) if you have additional
questions.

## v0.23.0

**NOTE** - Beginning with this release, a subset of the source code in the
[github.com/brimdata/brim](https://github.com/brimdata/brim) GitHub repository is
covered by a source-available style license, the
[Polyform Perimeter License (PPL)](https://polyformproject.org/licenses/perimeter/1.0.0/).
We've moved the PPL-covered code under a `ppl/` directory in the repository.
The majority of our source code retains the existing BSD-3-Clause license.

The overwhelming majority of Brim users and developers will not be impacted
by this change, including those using Brim in commercial settings. The use of
the source-available Polyform Perimeter license prevents use cases like
marketing a work as a replacement for the Brim desktop application while using
material covered under the PPL.

In general, we are making this change to ensure technology giants can't use the
PPL-covered code to make replacement offerings of our projects. We believe
users and developers should have access to the source code for our projects,
and we need a sustainable business model to continue funding our work. Using
the source-available Polyform Perimeter license on portions of the source code
lets us realize both.

**NOTICE for users who have added custom entries to their Query Library:**

We've become aware of an issue in Brim v0.22.0 where custom entries in the Query Library will **not be saved** if you quit by closing all your Brim windows (i.e. hitting the "X" in the upper-right of the window on Windows/Linux, or clicking the "red stoplights" on macOS). They _are_ saved if you quit via the pull-down menu (**File > Exit** on Windows/Linux, **Brim > Quit Brim** on macOS). Therefore, when closing Brim in prep for the v0.23.0 upgrade, make sure you quit via pull-down menu. When you're prompted to auto-update to v0.23.0 on Windows/macOS, select the option to Restart **Later** so that way you can quit via pull-down menu. We've fixed these issues so it should not be a problem in v0.23.0 and going forward. Sorry for the inconvenience!

## v0.21.1

- Update zq to [v0.26.0](https://github.com/brimdata/zed/releases/tag/v0.26.0), which fixes an issue that was causing pcap import failures, and also delivers other enhancements

## v0.21.0

**NOTE** - The Brim v0.21.0 release includes initial support for the
automatic generation of [Suricata](https://suricata.io/) alerts from imported pcaps.
The alert records may be isolated via a ZQL search `event_type=alert` and are
also included automatically alongside relevant Zeek event context in the
correlation visualization in the Log Detail view. The Suricata build that's
packaged with Brim uses the
[Emerging Threats Open ruleset](https://rules.emergingthreats.net/OPEN_download_instructions.html),
and Brim triggers a download of the most recent set of these rules each
time it is launched.

There are two known issues found during testing that may be bugs in Suricata
that impact the correctness of the alerts seen in Brim:

- When run on a system under heavy load, Suricata has sometimes been observed to generate fewer alerts than expected (or none at all) for a given pcap.
- Alerts may be generated with timestamps that are seconds/minutes further into the future beyond the end of the time range of the flow that triggered them.

These issues are still being investigated and more information will be provided
as they're better understood. More Suricata-related functionality is also
planned in upcoming releases. For now, please
[contact us on Slack](https://brimdata.io/join-slack/) or
[open an issue](https://github.com/brimdata/brim/wiki/Troubleshooting#opening-an-issue)
if you have any questions or problems with the new Suricata support, including
incidents of the issues described above.

  when you first launch the new version of Brim, a one-time bulk background
  update of the stored data for all of your existing Spaces will automatically
  begin. If you click to access a Space while migration is in progress, an
  animated "spinner" will be visible in the right of the Search bar. Once
  migration is complete for a Space, the bar chart will be filled in and the
  first splash of events will be shown and you can begin working with your Space
  as usual.
