## Powered By SuperDB

[SuperDB](https://superdb.org/docs) offers an innovative approach to working with data known as "[Super-Structured Data](https://www.brimdata.io/blog/super-structured-data/)".

Behind this app runs a local [server](https://superdb.org/docs/commands/super-db) instance where you can load your data into [pools](https://superdb.org/docs/commands/super-db/#data-pools) and use [SuperSQL](https://superdb.org/docs/language) to search, analyze, and transform it. Use it to:

- Explore deeply nested JSON objects
- View Parquet and Arrow IPC stream files
- Clean up CSV files by adding type information
- Search heterogeneous NDJSON logs
- Transform data from a legacy database's CDC logs
- Investigate [Zeek](https://zeek.org/) security logs

SuperDB provides a system to make working with data easier and more efficient. The [storage layer](https://superdb.org/docs/formats), [type system](https://superdb.org/docs/formats/data-model), [query language](https://superdb.org/docs/language/overview), and [cli tooling](https://superdb.org/docs/commands/super) are just a few of the tools SuperDB offers to the data community.
