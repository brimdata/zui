Zui is a desktop app for exploring and working with data.

Highlights:

- **Drag-and-drop** data ingestion
- **Automatic detection** of common data formats
- **Schema inference** during ingestion
- **Beautiful result views** for nested or tabular data
- **Named queries** with version history
- **Query session history** to keep track of your work
- **Pinnable query fragments** to keep your search box uncluttered
- **Right-click menus** for pivoting and filtering

## Powered By Zed

[Zed](https://zed.brimdata.io/docs) offers an innovative approach to working with data known as "[Super-Structured Data](https://www.brimdata.io/blog/super-structured-data/)".

Behind Zui is a local Zed lake instance where you can load your data into pools and use the powerful Zed language to search, analyze, and transform it. Use it to:

- Explore deeply nested JSON objects
- View Parquet and Arrow IPC stream files
- Clean up CSV files by adding type information
- Search heterogeneous NDJSON logs
- Transform data from a legacy database's CDC logs
- Investigate Zeek security logs

Zed provides a system to makes working with data easier and more efficient. The [storage layer](https://zed.brimdata.io/docs/formats), [type system](https://zed.brimdata.io/docs/formats/zed), [query language](https://zed.brimdata.io/docs/language/overview), and [zq](https://zed.brimdata.io/docs/commands/zq) command-line utility are just a few of the tools Zed offers to the data community.

## Formerly Known as "Brim"

For many years, the app was known as Brim, named after the company [Brim Data](https://www.brimdata.io/) that created it . In 2023, it was renamed to Zui, a play on "Zed User Interface", to better reflect its connection to the Zed technology that powers it.

Zui retains the security-specific features that made Brim popular while expanding its reach to anyone who has data to work with. For example, you'll still find the customized views, histograms, and correlations relevant to the security domain appearing in Zui via our nascent plugin system. In the future, developers will be able to create custom plugins that make Zui even more effective for their specific needs.
